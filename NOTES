Quit app after last window closes.
Page tabs for each image.
    Keeps tab zoom and pan in sync.
    Easy key to swap between them (Space?).
    See tab hotkeys in Window menu.
        Maybe change to left and right arrow keys.
When keeping picker in sync across tab, maybe use relative position rather than absolute.
    Then we can compare resized images.
If file is in git tree and is modified/staged, offer to diff.
    Add menu items:
        File -> Open head version
        File -> Open staged version
    Enable these based on git status.
    When selected, get file, store somewhere, open with document controller.
    To get value in index: git show :path/to/file
    To get value in head: git show HEAD:path/to/file
Auto-fit window on startup.
Don't open windows that were open when we last closed.
    Look at --fresh option of "open" command.
Resolve tab/window title copy.
Add menu item to gather windows.
Zoom In hotkey should say "Option Plus" but also respond to "Option Equals".
Zoom In hotkey should say "Option Minus" but also respond to "Options Hyphen" and "Option Underscore".
Handle dropping images onto UI.

Handle pasting an image (Command-V).
    Create new untitled image.
    Might imply saving file.
Toggle alpha display: RGBA over checkerboard vs. alpha mask only (B/W).
Automatic and instant reload of changed file on disk.
    Don't change zoom or pan.
    After reload, can toggle displaying current and previous.
        Create pseudo-file, like another tab?
Clean up menu items, including Preferences.
Write README.md.

Maybe:

Allow pan more freedom, as long as center of view always has image in it.
App opens behind other windows when run from command line.
    That's because we're running the actual executable instead of the .app.
        Could force ourselves to the front?
    Running the .app (with "open r_view.app --args foo.png") works but CWD is different (/),
        so file can't be found.
    Running the .app this way works:
        open -a /Users/lk/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/r_view-ahptkqnzsimafjbtutjcicnrzkyo/Build/Products/Debug/r_view.app [filenames...]
        Except that NSLog() doesn't show.
            So run Console.app and filter for "r_view".
